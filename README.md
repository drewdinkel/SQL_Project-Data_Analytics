# My SQL Data Analytics Project

I completed this project showcasing my skills in SQL with the help of Luke Barousse's "SQL for Data Analytics" YouTube video (https://youtu.be/7mz73uXD9DA?si=_oPuzqS83rJGVBsi). This project aimed to analyze the top paying data jobs, the top paying data skills, the most demanded data skills, and how these three variables fit together. Throughout the process I learned all the basics of writing SQL code by learning to utilize important keywords like SELECT, FROM, WHERE, ORDER BY, LIMIT, and a couple more.

## What I Learned From This Project
- **Writing Queries:** Got a firm grasp on the basic skills of SQL that allow you to not only filter data, but also retrieve it. For the purposes of this project, I wrote queries that filtered by things like job title and average salary, allowing me to retrieve only the data I found interesting and meaningful.
- **Database Operations:** Gained hands-on experience creating subqueries and common table expressions (CTEs) as well as using unions to combine queries. This allowed me to work only with the data I thought was necessary while also improving readability.
- **Data Analysis:** Utilized aggregate functions such as AVG() and COUNT() in a GROUP BY statement to allow the user an easier time viewing and analyzing relationships.
